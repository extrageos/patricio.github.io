  aboutMe:
    "I am a Computer Engineer with a strong interest in computer hardware, system design, and the intersection of electronics and computing. My focus is on understanding how hardware and software work together, from low-level circuits to fully integrated systems. I enjoy working on hardware design, troubleshooting, and optimization, while continuously expanding my knowledge in embedded systems, digital logic, and microcontroller-based projects. Driven by curiosity and hands-on problem solving, I aim to contribute to building reliable, efficient, and innovative hardware solutions.",
